# Halloween-discord-bot
This bot is actually quite simple, at first i thought i would have to create an image embeding system in order to properly display an image in the message turns out, if you have the ability to host you image, and get a direct link to it, it is much simpler because, when the link to the image is sent, discord embeds it for you, and hides the link.

The bot creation tool that I used is pretty much unique, at https://pylon.bot it allows you to write you bot in python, and they will host it for you.

the code can be found in the "Code" section, and is simply a message randomiser, I have also included the second part of the bot, which allows users (except the owner of the server) to add costumes to their account, this essentially sets a server-wide nickname for that user to the costume chosen.

Finally, if you want a costom name for the bot, simply right click on the bot's name in discord, and select "change nickname".
