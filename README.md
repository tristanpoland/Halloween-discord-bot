# Halloween-discord-bot
This bot is actually quite simple, at first i thought i would have to create an image embeding system in order to properly display an image in the message turns out, if you have the ability to host you image, and get a direct link to it, it is much simpler.

The bot creation tool that I used is pretty much unique, at https://pylon.bot it allows you to write you bot in python, and they will host it for you

the code can be found in the "Code" section, and is simply a message randomiser, I have also included the second part of the bot, which allows users (except the owner of the server) to add costumes to their account, this essentially sets a server-wide nickname for that user to the costume chosen.
